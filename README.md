# CDC-Placements

I was able to get offer at Sprinklr as Data Scientist role through on campus placements. It was with immense dedication and efforts on learning coding via platforms like Algozenith, Leetcode and InterviewBit, along with probablity and statistics being practiced from 50 challenging problems, heard on street and few other books. One of the best ways during my coding preparation was by Neetcode YouTube videos. The various playlists are wholesome and provide in depth knowledge on how to think and approach any coding question. I was also able to perform exteremly well in my interviews at Morgan Stanley and Microsoft, by answering all coding and other questions with a very positive impact. However, due to unforseen situation and coincidence of timing I was unable to get them never the less appreciated for the candidature.

The repository consists of the various materials, resources, my candidature [Data Scientist] and details about the various companies that came for oncampus placement at IIT Kharagpur.
